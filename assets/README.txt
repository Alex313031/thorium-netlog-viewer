# Thorium NetLog Viewer
Fork of the Chromium NetLog Viewer

This app loads NetLog .json files generated by Thorium or Chromium's `chrome://net-export`. Log data is processed and visualized entirely on the client side (your browser). Data is never uploaded to a remote endpoint.

The latest version of the Thorium Net Log Viewer can be accessed at https://thorium.rocks/misc/thorium_netlog_viewer/netlog.html

## Usage
Go to *chrome://net-export/* and start a logging session. When you stop the session it will save the log file. By default it will save `chrome-net-export-log.json` to your Downloads folder. You can then upload/drag n' drop the file into the NetLog window.

Advanced Usage: For more advanced usage, including starting logging when Thorium starts, see > https://www.chromium.org/for-testers/providing-network-details/

To run locally, clone the repo, and then you can run `serve_static.sh` (Linux), or `serve_static.bat` (Windows) and open your browser to http://0.0.0.0:8086/netlog.html to use it.
